## Preparation

The main features of VGen are as follows:
- Expandability, allowing for easy management of your own experiments.
- Completeness, encompassing all common components for video generation.
- Excellent performance, featuring powerful pre-trained models in multiple tasks.


### Installation

```
conda create -n vgen python=3.8
conda activate vgen
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 torchvision==0.13.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

You  also need to ensure that your system has installed the `ffmpeg` command. If it is not installed, you can install it using the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6  -y
```


### Datasets

We have provided a **demo dataset** that includes images and videos, along with their lists in ``data``. 

*Please note that the demo images used here are for testing purposes and were not included in the training.*


### Clone the code

```
git clone https://github.com/ali-vilab/VGen.git
cd VGen
```


## Getting Started with VGen

### (1) Train your text-to-video model


Executing the following command to enable distributed training is as easy as that.
```
python train_net.py --cfg configs/t2v_train.yaml
```

In the `t2v_train.yaml` configuration file, you can specify the data, adjust the video-to-image ratio using `frame_lens`, and validate your ideas with different Diffusion settings, and so on.

- Before the training, you can download any of our open-source models for initialization. Our codebase supports custom initialization and `grad_scale` settings, all of which are included in the `Pretrain` item in yaml file.
- During the training, you can view the saved models and intermediate inference results in the `workspace/experiments/t2v_train`directory.

After the training is completed, you can perform inference on the model using the following command.
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/t2v_infer.yaml
```
Then you can find the videos you generated in the `workspace/experiments/test_img_01` directory. For specific configurations such as data, models, seed, etc., please refer to the `t2v_infer.yaml` file.


*If you want to directly load our previously open-sourced [Modelscope T2V model](https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/modelscope-damo-text-to-video-synthesis/tree/main), please refer to [this link](https://github.com/damo-vilab/i2vgen-xl/issues/31).*

    </center></td>
  </tr>
</center>
</table>
</center> -->




### (2) Run the I2VGen-XL model

(i) Download model and test data:
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('damo/I2VGen-XL', cache_dir='models/', revision='v1.0.0')
```

or you can also download it through HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/i2vgen-xl):
```
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/i2vgen-xl
```


(ii) Run the following command:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/i2vgen_xl_infer.yaml
```
or you can run:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/i2vgen_xl_infer.yaml  test_list_path data/test_list_for_i2vgen.txt test_model models/i2vgen_xl_00854500.pth
```
The `test_list_path` represents the input image path and its corresponding caption. Please refer to the specific format and suggestions within demo file `data/test_list_for_i2vgen.txt`. `test_model` is the path for loading the model. In a few minutes, you can retrieve the high-definition video you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/test_list_for_i2vgen` directory. At present, we find that the current model performs inadequately on **anime images** and **images with a black background** due to the lack of relevant training data. We are consistently working to optimize it.


(iii) Run the gradio app locally:
```
python gradio_app.py
```

(iv) Run the model on ModelScope and HuggingFace:
- [Modelscope](https://modelscope.cn/studios/damo/I2VGen-XL/summary)
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/damo-vilab/I2VGen-XL)

(ii) Run the following command:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/i2vgen_xl_train.yaml
```
In a few minutes, you can retrieve the high-definition video you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/test_img_01` directory. At present, we find that the current model performs inadequately on **anime images** and **images with a black background** due to the lack of relevant training data.

### (3) Run the HiGen model

(i) Download model:
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('iic/HiGen', cache_dir='models/')
```
Then you might need the following command to move the checkpoints to the "models/" directory:
```
mv ./models/iic/HiGen/* ./models/
```

(ii) Run the following command for text-to-video generation:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/higen_infer.yaml
```
In a few minutes, you can retrieve the videos you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/text_list_for_t2v_share` directory.
Then you can execute the following command to perform super-resolution on the generated videos:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/sr600_infer.yaml
```
Finally, you can retrieve the high-definition video from the `workspace/experiments/text_list_for_t2v_share` directory.

### (4) DreamVideo
Our DreamVideo uses `ModelScopeT2V V1.5` as the base video diffusion model. `ModelScopeT2V V1.5 is further fine-tuned on ModelScopeT2V for 365k iterations with more data.`

#### Download ModelScopeT2V V1.5 and adapter weights of DreamVideo
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('iic/dreamvideo-t2v', cache_dir='models/')
```
Then you might need the following command to move the checkpoints to the "models/" directory:
```
mv ./models/iic/dreamvideo-t2v/* ./models/
```
Or you can download the checkpoint of ModelScopeT2V V1.5 and adapter weights of DreamVideo from this [link](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/dreamvideo-t2v/files). 

#### Training
(i) Subject Learning

Step 1: learn a textual identity using Textual Inversion.
```
python train_net.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/subjectLearning/dog2_subjectLearning_step1.yaml
```

Step 2: train an identity adapter by incorporating the learned textual identity.
```
python train_net.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/subjectLearning/dog2_subjectLearning_step2.yaml
```

Tips:
- Generally, step 1 takes `1500 to 3000` training steps, and step 2 takes `500 to 1000` training steps. For certain subjects (like cats, etc.), excessive training may generate unnatural videos, and using text embedding with fewer training steps or reducing the training steps of step 2 may help.
- For some subjects (like dogs, etc.), setting `use_mask_diffusion` to `True` may achieve better results. Make sure to put the binary masks of the subject into the folder `data/images/custom/YOUR_SUBJECT/masks`, and you can use [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to obtain these masks.

(ii) Motion Learning

Train a motion adapter on the given videos.
```
python train_net.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/motionLearning/carTurn_motionLearning.yaml
```

You can customize your own configuration files for subject/motion learning.

Tips:
- Generally, motion learning takes `500 to 2000` training steps.
- Try setting `p_image_zero` from `0 to 0.5` to adjust the effect of appearance guidance during training.
- Try increasing training steps or increasing the learning rate for single video motion customization to better align the motion pattern.


#### Inference
(i) Subject Customization
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/infer/subject_dog2.yaml
```

(ii) Motion Customization
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/infer/motion_carTurn.yaml
```
For inference with appearance guidance, make sure to add images of foreground objects (e.g., any image of a bear) to the folder `data/images/motionReferenceImgs` and modify your test file.

Tips:
- Try setting `appearance_guide_strength_cond` and `appearance_guide_strength_uncond` from `0 to 1` to adjust the effect of appearance guidance during inference.
- We do not use DDIM Inversion by default. However, for single video motion customization, you can try setting `inverse_noise_strength` to `0~0.5` to better align the training video. For multi-video motion customization, we recommend setting `inverse_noise_strength` to `0`.


(iii) Joint Customization
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/infer/joint_dog2_carTurn.yaml
```

Tips:
- Try changing `identity_adapter_index` and `motion_adapter_index` for better results. Typically, increasing identity_adapter_index improves identity preservation, while increasing motion_adapter_index enhances motion alignment. Balance the two for optimal results.


#### Examples
We provide some examples for inference. Before you start, make sure you download the models.

(i) Subject Customization
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/infer/examples/subject_dog2.yaml

python inference.py --cfg configs/dreamvideo/infer/examples/subject_wolf_plushie.yaml

#### Metric Calculation

We provide code that includes the calculation of metrics for `CLIP-T`, `CLIP-I`, `DINO-I`, and `Temporal Consistency`. Please refer to [metric/README.MD](./metric/README.MD) for more details.


### (5) Run the TF-T2V (CVPR-2024) model

(i) Download model:
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('iic/tf-t2v', cache_dir='models/')
```
Then you might need the following command to move the checkpoints to the "models/" directory:
```
mv ./models/iic/tf-t2v/* ./models/
```

(ii) We provide a config file for generating 16-frame video with 448x256 resolution. The command is as follows:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_t2v_infer.yaml
```
(If there are environmental problems during operation, we also provide the environment configuration "tft2v_environment.yaml" of TF-T2V for your reference.)


In a few minutes, you can retrieve the videos you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/text_list_for_tft2v` directory.
Then you can execute the following command to perform super-resolution on the generated videos:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_16frames_sr600_infer.yaml
```
Finally, you can retrieve the high-definition video from the `workspace/experiments/text_list_for_tft2v` directory.
(It should be noted that the super-resolution model only supports 32-frame input, and 16-frame video cannot be used, thus we construct a pseudo 32-frame video by copying frames.)

(iii) Additionally, you can run the following command for text-to-video generation (32 frames):
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_t2v_32frames_infer.yaml
```

In a few minutes, you can retrieve the videos you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/text_list_for_tft2v_32frame` directory.
Then you can execute the following command to perform super-resolution on the generated videos:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_32frames_sr600_infer.yaml
```
Finally, you can retrieve the high-definition video from the `workspace/experiments/text_list_for_tft2v_32frame` directory.
(It should be noted that the super-resolution model only supports 32-frame input, and 16-frame video cannot be used.)

(iv) Run the following command for compositional video generation like videocomposer (32 frames):

```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_vcomposer_32frames_infer.yaml
```
In a few minutes, you can retrieve the videos you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/vid_list_vcomposer_32frame` directory.
Then you can execute the following command to perform super-resolution on the generated videos:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_vcomposer_32frames_sr600_infer.yaml
```
Finally, you can retrieve the high-definition video from the `workspace/experiments/vid_list_vcomposer_32frame` directory.

(v) We also provide a config file for generating 16-frame video with 448x256 resolution under the compositional video synthesis setting. The command is as follows:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_vcomposer_infer.yaml
```
You can also generate a 16-frame video with 896x512 resolution within one model by running:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/tft2v_vcomposer_896x512_infer.yaml
```

It should be noted that the super-resolution model only supports 32-frame input, and 16-frame video cannot be used.



### (6) Run the VideoLCM model

(i) Download models as in TF-T2V (if you have already downloaded them in TF-T2V, skip this step):
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('iic/tf-t2v', cache_dir='models/')
```
Then you might need the following command to move the checkpoints to the "models/" directory:
```
mv ./models/iic/tf-t2v/* ./models/
```

(ii) Run the following command for text-to-video generation (16 frames with 448x256 resolution):
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/videolcm_t2v_infer.yaml
```

To generate high-resolution videos (1280x720 resolution), you can run the following command:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/videolcm_t2v_16frames_sr600_infer.yaml
```

### (7) InstructVideo (CVPR 2024)

Feel free to reach out (hj.yuan@zju.edu.cn) if have questions.

#### Dataset preparation and environment configuration
The training of InstructVideo requires video-text pairs to save computational cost during reward fine-tuning.
In the paper, we utilize a small set of videos in WebVid to fine-tune our base model.
The file list is shown under the folder:
```
data/instructvideo/webvid_simple_animals_2_selected_20_train_file_list/00000.txt
```
You should try filtering the videos from your webvid dataset to compose the training data. Another alternative is to use your own video-text pairs.
(I tested InstructVideo on WebVid data and some proprietary data. Both worked.)

Concerning the environment configuration, you should follow the instructions for [VGen installation](https://github.com/ali-vilab/VGen?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).


#### Pre-trained weights preparation
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('iic/InstructVideo', cache_dir='models/')
```
You need to move the checkpoints to the "models/" directory:
```
mv ./models/iic/InstructVideo/* ./models/
```
Note that `models/model_scope_v1-4_0600000.pth` is the pre-trained base model used in the paper.
The fine-tuned model is placed under the folder `models/instructvideo-finetuned`.

You can get access to the provided files on [Instructvideo ModelScope Page](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/InstructVideo/files).


#### The inference of InstructVideo
You can leverage the provided fine-tuned checkpoints to generate videos by running the command:
```
bash configs/instructvideo/eval_generate_videos.sh
```
This command uses yaml files under `configs/instructvideo/eval`, containing caption file paths for generating videos of in-domain animals, new animals and non-animals.
Feel free to switch among them or replace them with your own captions.
Although we fine-tuned using 20-step DDIM, you can still use 50-step DDIM generation.

#### The reward fine-tuning of InstructVideo
You can perform InstrcutVideo reward fine-tuning by running the command:
```
bash configs/instructvideo/train.sh
```
Since performing reward fine-tuning can lead to over-optimization, I strongly recommend checking the generation performance on some evaluation captions regularly (like the captions indicated in `configs/instructvideo/eval`).


### (8) Other methods

In preparation!!


## Customize your own approach
